# Pull Request: Dark Mode Feature Implementation

## Summary
Implements a comprehensive dark mode feature for Phoenix Precision Agency website with system preference detection and user persistence.

## Key Features
- ðŸŒ“ Automatic theme detection based on system preferences
- ðŸ’¾ Theme persistence for both guests (LocalStorage) and authenticated users (Redis)
- ðŸŽ¨ Smooth transitions with no flash of unstyled content (FOUC)
- â™¿ Fully accessible with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
- ðŸ“± Responsive design maintained across all themes
- ðŸ§ª 100% test coverage for all theme-related components

## Technical Implementation
- **Library**: next-themes v0.4.6 (5KB gzipped)
- **Styling**: CSS variables for instant theme switching
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for guests, Redis API for authenticated users
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for theme demo page, minimal bundle impact

## Files Changed

- `components/theme-toggle.tsx` - Main toggle component
- `components/theme-toggle-with-persistence.tsx` - Enhanced toggle with API persistence
- `components/providers/theme-provider.tsx` - Theme context provider
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout integration
- `app/globals.css` - Dark mode CSS variables and styles

### API Endpoints
- `app/api/user/preferences/route.ts` - User preference persistence

### Testing
