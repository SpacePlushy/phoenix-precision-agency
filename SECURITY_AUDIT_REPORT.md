# Security Audit Report - Phoenix Precision Agency

**Date**: August 4, 2025
**Auditor**: Cline (AI Assistant)
**Severity**: HIGH - Critical security vulnerabilities identified

## Executive Summary

This security audit has identified several critical vulnerabilities in the Phoenix Precision Agency project that could expose the application to XSS attacks, code injection, and authentication failures. Immediate action is required to address these issues before deploying to production.

## Critical Security Issues (HIGH Severity)

### 1. Missing Required Clerk Domains in CSP

**Issue**: The current CSP configuration in `middleware.ts` is missing critical Clerk domains required for proper authentication functionality.
**Risk**: Authentication features will fail in production, making the application unusable.
**OWASP Reference**: A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures

**Missing Domains**:

- `https://YOUR-INSTANCE.clerk.accounts.dev` (instance-specific domain)
- `https://clerk-telemetry.com`
- `https://*.clerk-telemetry.com`

### 2. Overly Permissive `unsafe-eval`

**Issue**: The CSP configuration contains `'unsafe-eval'` which allows execution of dynamically generated code.
**Risk**: Exposes the application to potential code injection attacks through `eval()`, `new Function()`, `setTimeout()`, and `setInterval()` with string arguments.
**OWASP Reference**: A03:2021 – Injection

### 3. Wildcard HTTPS Sources in `img-src`

**Issue**: The `img-src` directive allows `https:` which permits loading images from ANY HTTPS source.
**Risk**: Could allow malicious image sources to be loaded, potentially leading to data exfiltration or other attacks.
**OWASP Reference**: A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

## Medium Severity Issues

### 4. Development-specific Domains in Production CSP

**Issue**: The CSP includes `ws://localhost:*` and `wss://localhost:*` which are only needed in development.
**Risk**: Unnecessary exposure of localhost WebSocket connections in production.
**Recommendation**: Use environment-specific configurations to exclude these in production.

### 5. Missing Security Directives

**Issue**: Several important security directives are missing from the CSP:

- `object-src 'none'` (prevents Flash/plugins)
- `base-uri 'self'` (prevents base tag injection)
- `form-action 'self'` (restricts where forms can submit data)

**Risk**: Missing these directives leaves gaps in protection against various attack vectors.
**OWASP Reference**: A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

## Low Severity Issues

### 6. `unsafe-inline` in Scripts

**Issue**: The CSP uses `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts and styles which is required by Next.js and Clerk but not ideal.
**Risk**: Lower risk but could be improved with a nonce-based approach.
**Recommendation**: Consider implementing a nonce-based CSP for better security in future iterations.

## Detailed Recommendations

### 1. Update CSP Configuration

Replace the current CSP implementation in `middleware.ts` with an environment-aware configuration:

```typescript
const getCSPHeader = (isDevelopment: boolean) => {
  const clerkInstanceDomain =
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API ||
    "https://YOUR-INSTANCE.clerk.accounts.dev";

  const baseCSP = {
    "default-src": ["'self'"],
    "script-src": [
      "'self'",
      "'unsafe-inline'", // Required by Next.js and Clerk
      clerkInstanceDomain,
      "https://*.clerk.accounts.dev",
      "https://clerk.com",
      "https://challenges.cloudflare.com",
      isDevelopment && "https://vercel.live",
    ].filter(Boolean),
    "style-src": [
      "'self'",
      "'unsafe-inline'", // Required by Clerk components
      "https://*.clerk.accounts.dev",
    ],
    "img-src": [
      "'self'",
      "data:",
      "https://img.clerk.com",
      "https://www.gravatar.com",
      "https://images.clerk.dev",
    ],
    "font-src": ["'self'", "data:", "https://*.clerk.accounts.dev"],
    "connect-src": [
      "'self'",
      clerkInstanceDomain,
      "https://*.clerk.accounts.dev",
      "https://clerk.com",
      "https://api.clerk.com",
      "https://clerk-telemetry.com",
      "https://*.clerk-telemetry.com",
      isDevelopment && "ws://localhost:*",
      isDevelopment && "wss://localhost:*",
    ].filter(Boolean),
    "frame-src": ["'self'", "https://challenges.cloudflare.com"],
    "object-src": ["'none'"],
    "base-uri": ["'self'"],
    "form-action": ["'self'"],
    "frame-ancestors": ["'none'"],
    "upgrade-insecure-requests": [],
  };

  // Convert to string format
  return Object.entries(baseCSP)
    .map(([key, values]) => {
      if (values.length === 0) return key;
      return `${key} ${values.join(" ")}`;
    })
    .join("; ");
};
```

### 2. Remove `unsafe-eval` from CSP

Ensure that `'unsafe-eval'` is not included in any CSP directives, especially `script-src`.

### 3. Restrict Image Sources

Replace the overly permissive `https:` with specific domains that are actually needed for the application.

### 4. Environment-specific Configuration

Implement different CSP configurations for development and production environments to avoid including unnecessary directives in production.

### 5. Add Missing Security Directives

Include the following directives in your CSP:

- `object-src 'none'` to prevent plugin content
- `base-uri 'self'` to prevent base tag manipulation
- `form-action 'self'` to restrict form submissions

## Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Implement CSP Violation Reporting

Add a CSP reporting endpoint to monitor violations in production:

```typescript
// Add to CSP configuration
'report-uri': '/api/csp-report',
'report-to': 'csp-endpoint'
```

And create an API route to handle reports:

```typescript
// /api/csp-report
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const violation = await request.json();
  // Log violation for monitoring
  console.warn("CSP Violation:", violation);
  // Consider sending to a security monitoring service
  return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
}
```

### 2. Add Security Headers

Ensure all recommended security headers are set:

- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

### 3. Regular Security Audits

Implement a process for regular security audits:

1. Review CSP configuration periodically
2. Monitor CSP violation reports
3. Update security headers as needed
4. Keep dependencies updated
