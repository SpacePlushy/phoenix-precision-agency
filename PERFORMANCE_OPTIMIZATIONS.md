# Phoenix Precision Agency - Performance Optimizations

## Demo Section Animation Performance Improvements

### 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Created `LazyDemoContainer` wrapper that uses Next.js dynamic imports
- Demo section only loads when approaching viewport (50px margin)
- Disabled SSR for animation-heavy component to reduce initial bundle
- Added loading skeleton to improve perceived performance

### 2. Intersection Observer Implementation
- Created `useAnimationObserver` hook for efficient visibility detection
- Animations only run when component is visible
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation starts
- Disconnects observer after first intersection to reduce overhead

### 3. CSS Containment & Chrome Optimizations
- Added `contain: layout style paint` to demo sections
- Implemented `content-visibility: auto` for off-screen optimization
- Added vendor prefixes for all transform properties
- Used `isolation: isolate` to reduce paint areas

### 4. GPU Acceleration Enhancements
- Applied `translateZ(0)` hack with vendor prefixes
- Added `-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden` to prevent flickering
- Used `will-change: transform` judiciously on animated elements
- Added perspective to create new stacking contexts

### 5. RequestAnimationFrame for Progress Animation
- Replaced `setInterval` with `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother updates
- Uses high-precision timing with `performance.now()`
- Automatically syncs with browser's repaint cycle
- Reduces unnecessary renders between frames

### 6. Resource Optimization
- Added `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` to images
- Specified explicit width/height to prevent layout shifts
- Fonts already configured with `display: swap`

### 7. Chrome-Specific CSS Features
```css
@supports (-webkit-appearance: none) {
  /* Chrome-specific optimizations */
}
```

### 8. Performance Monitoring
- Created `PerformanceReporter` component for tracking metrics
- Monitors Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, Long Tasks)
- `useRenderPerformance` hook for component-level monitoring

## Usage

The optimizations are automatically applied. To monitor performance:

1. Open Chrome DevTools > Performance tab
2. Look for custom performance marks in the timeline
3. Check console for Web Vitals reporting
4. Use Lighthouse for comprehensive analysis

## Results Expected

- Smoother animations in Chrome, especially during scrolling
- Reduced CPU usage during animation sequences
- Better frame rates (targeting 60fps)
- Lower Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Improved Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) scores
